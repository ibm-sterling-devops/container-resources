Custom Properties

The customization init image can be used to configure override files and adding new/updating existing product property files. The out of the box customization init image defines the below structure for custom properties with placeholder files for customer_overrides.properties and system_overrides.properties which can then be updated by extending the image

ibm
 b2bi
  customization
   properties
    customer_overrides.properties
    system_overrides.properties

Product configurations supported by the customer overrides or system overrides framework can be added to the overrides property files following the standard nomenclature as below
<file-prefix>.<property-name>=<property-value>

Apart from the above overrides files, any product configuration or property file with or without the
'.in' extension can be updated with custom values and placed in the properties folder. Also new properties files that need to be added to the <install-dir>/properties location can be placed in the properties folder. At runtime these property files(s) will be copied over and replaced in the <install-dir>/property folder. This provides a better alternative to the current property customization option by placing the property files (*.in) under the <helm-chart>/config folder.

If the Property file is specific to asi or ac or api, then the property file name should be prefixed with "asi-" "ac-" "api-" respectively.
