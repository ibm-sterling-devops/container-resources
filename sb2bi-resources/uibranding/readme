The customization init image can be used to apply branding changes for these supported war files
1. Dashboard
2. Mailbox
3. Filegateway
4. Myfilegateway
5. MyFG20

The out of the box customization init image comes bundled with the default branding artifacts for each of the above war files. In case branding artifacts are updated for any of the war files then the corresponding flag for the war also needs to be enabled in apply-branding.properties. For example, if the branding artifacts for dashboard are updated then toggle  the flag for dashboard in apply-branding.properties to true as below
cat apply-branding.properties
 dashboard=true
 mailbox=false
 filegateway=false
 myfilegateway=false
 myfg20=false

For details on updating the branding artifacts for each of the supported war files, the respective produc documentation can be referred.
