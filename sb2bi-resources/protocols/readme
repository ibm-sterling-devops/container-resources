Custom SFG Protocols

The customization init image can be used to configure custom SFG protocol files. The out of the box
customization init image defines the below structure for custom protocols with reference files for
AFTExtensions.xml and AFTExtensions.properties and placeholder files AFTExtensionsCustomer.xml and
AFTExtensionsCustomer.properties for defining custom protocols which can be updated by extending the
image

ibm
 b2bi
  customization
   protocols
    AFTExtensions.xml
    AFTExtensions.properties
    AFTExtensionsCustomer.xml
    AFTExtensionsCustomer.properties

The AFTExtensions.xml and AFTExtensions.properties are only for reference and not be edited. They can be
used as a guide to add the custom protocol entries to AFTExtensionsCustomer.xml and AFTExtensionsCustomer.properties.
