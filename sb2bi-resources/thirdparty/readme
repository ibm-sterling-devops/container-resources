Custom Thirdparty Libraries

The customization init image can be used to configure custom thirdparty libraries including jars,
database driver jars, properties and shared or native libraries . The out of the box customization init
image defines the below structure for custom thirdparty libraries with placeholder folders for each
thirdparty type along with placeholder files for pre-dynamicclasspath.cfg.in and pre-dynamicclasspathAC.cfg
which can then be updated by extending the image

    pre-dynamicclasspath.cfg.in
    pre-dynamicclasspathAC.cfg

All custom thirdparty jars, dbjars, properties or shared libraries that are to be applied to the product
are required to be placed in the above structure as per the third party type. Also each thirdparty file
needs to be enclosed in its vendor name and version sub folders so that the appropriate vendor
name and version could be added to its path in dynamic classpath. All files not placed under the
appropriate structure including the vendor name and version sub folders will be ignored while adding
dynamic classpath entries. The pre-dynamicclasspath.cfg.in, applicable for asi containers, and
pre-dynamiclasspathAC.cfg, applicable for ac containers, can be used to place any thirdparty jars, dbjars
properties at the top of the application dynamic classpath in case there of any conflicts with the product
libraries.

Here are few examples below to demonstrate how the binaries or property files are to be placed under vendor
name and version folders inside the respective thirdparty type folders. For example, the seas-sso.jar needs
to be placed under the thirdparty/jars/seas-sso/1.0 folder structure. Similarly for the aws sdk jars or
seas-sso property files or mssql database driver jar or sapjco native library.
